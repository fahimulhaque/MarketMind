## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security is a priority for the MarketMind project. If you discover a security vulnerability within MarketMind, we kindly ask that you do **not** open a public issue. By privately disclosing vulnerabilities, you give the maintainers time to coordinate a fix and release it before the vulnerability is made public.

To report a vulnerability, please use the **GitHub Security Advisories** feature:
Go to `Security` -> `Advisories` -> `Report a vulnerability` on the repository page.

### What to include in your report
- High-level overview of the vulnerability.
- Proof of Concept (PoC) or detailed steps to reproduce.
- Potential impact of the vulnerability.
- Any suggested mitigations or fixes.

### Response Timeline
We aim to acknowledge receipt of vulnerability reports within 48 hours. After acknowledging the report, we will evaluate the vulnerability and communicate a timeline for a patch. We will keep you updated on the progress as the fix is developed and released.
